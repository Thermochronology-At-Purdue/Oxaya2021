This repository contains spreadsheets used to calculate diffusive loss of argon from sanidine for the manuscript, "Time scales for pluton growth, magma chamber formation and super-eruptions" by M.E. van Zalinge, D.F. Mark, R.S.J. Sparks, Tremblay, M.M., C.B. Keller, F.J. Cooper and A. Rust. The repository contains two separate excel files, Oxaya2021_

the code used to model diffusive loss of argon from sanidine for the manuscript, "Time scales for pluton growth, magma chamber formation and super-eruptions" by M.E. van Zalinge, D.F. Mark, R.S.J. Sparks, Tremblay, M.M., C.B. Keller, F.J. Cooper and A. Rust. The repository contains two separate codes: coldstorage.m, which was used to calculate the cold storage conditions shown in Figure 3a, and residencetime.m, which was used to calculate the magma residence times and ignimbrite post-emplacement temperatures shown in Figuers 3b and 3c. These codes were written in Matlab version R2019a, and running the codes requires the Matlab Optimization Toolbox.
