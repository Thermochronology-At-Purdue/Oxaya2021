# Oxaya2021

This repository contains spreadsheets used to calculate diffusive loss of argon from sanidine for the manuscript, "Time scales for pluton growth, magma chamber formation and super-eruptions" by M.E. van Zalinge, D.F. Mark, R.S.J. Sparks, Tremblay, M.M., C.B. Keller, F.J. Cooper and A. Rust. The repository contains two separate excel files: Oxaya2021_storage.xlsx, which was used to calculate the cold storage conditions shown in Figure 3a, and Oxaya2021_residencetimes.xslx, which was used to calculate the magma residence times and ignimbrite post-emplacement temperatures shown in Figuers 3b and 3c. We will also upload python scripts with equivalent calulations to this repository.
